		//3. Ask the user what color they would like the robot to draw
		
		//5. Use an if/else statement to set the pen color that the user requested

        //6. If the user doesn’t enter anything, choose a random color

        //7. Put a loop around your code so that you keep asking the user for more colors & drawing them
		
		//4. Set the pen width to 10
		
	    //2. Make the robot draw a shape (this will take more than one line of code)
